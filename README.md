# Spacey 👩‍🚀🚀🌑

## A Vanilla JS adventure in space

_THIS IS A NON-COMMERCIAL-PROJECT AS FINAL THESIS FOR MY WEB DEVELOPER BOOTCAMP AT [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/)_

In Spacey the player has to save a little astronaut from a lonley planet, but time is ticking. The game logic is based on Vanilla Javascript and is part of a react-app.

In version 1.0 there is only one level, but more levels and a highscore system will be implemented with future versions.

Current version: 1.0 || 09.10.2020

## Deployment 🎮

The game is deployed on Heroku. Play it here: [Spacey Game](https://spacey-game.herokuapp.com/home)

The app is designed and laid out for smartphone screens, so adjust the settings in your view accordingly to IPhone 6/7/8 to have the best experience.

Unfortunatly the game can only be played on PC in Version 1.0

## Design 🖌

## Install all dependencies

`npm install`

Since there is a postinstall, the system automatically searches the client folder and installs the required dependencies there, too.
